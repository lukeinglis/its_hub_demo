class BetaSelfConsistency(SelfConsistency):
    """Self-consistency with Beta-distribution adaptive stopping (Aggarwal et al., 2023).

    Fires all budget requests concurrently and checks the Beta posterior
    probability as each response arrives. Stops and cancels remaining
    requests once the probability that the majority answer will remain
    dominant exceeds confidence_threshold (default 0.95).

    This fully utilizes vLLM's continuous batching while still getting
    the sample-efficiency benefits of adaptive stopping.

    Let v1 and v2 be the vote counts for the two most common answers. Starting
    from a uniform Beta(1, 1) prior, their posterior is Beta(v1 + 1, v2 + 1).
    Generation stops when the posterior probability that the leading answer's
    vote share exceeds 0.5 reaches the configured threshold:

        P(leader's vote share > 0.5) = 1 - I_0.5(v1 + 1, v2 + 1)

    Reference: "Let's Sample Step by Step: Adaptive-Consistency for Efficient
    Reasoning and Coding with LLMs" (EMNLP 2023)

    Inherits tool_vote, exclude_args, and projection support from
    SelfConsistency.
